# Tea share

The platform for sharing images.

## Description

Tea share is a Typescript based online image sharing platform for Android, IOS and the Web. It provides a smooth UI to interact and scroll through posts and allows you to
create posts easily with the click of a button. It is built with React native on the Expo framework. It uses **Mongodb** as the
database, **Node.js** as the server side runtime and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for authentication and storage for all the user generated data.

The web version is a younger version of the App. It was released for more users for desktop,
Although there is a Desktop version in development which will be built with Electron.

Currently the IOS version is not available but it will be soon. After the IOS version is ready,
it will be available in this repository.

> NOTE: The Mobile version of the app is currently migrating to Vanilla React Native WITHOUT Expo. It is currently not available but it is still being worked on and will be available by next month.
